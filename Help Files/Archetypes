A master strategist who uses a blend of consistency, placement, and endurance to construct points and out-maneuver opponents, rather than overpowering them.
* **Primary:** `Stamina (sta)`, `Serve Accuracy (sa)`
* **Secondary:** `Groundstroke (gs)`, `Reflex (ref)`
* **Rubber Band:** `Serve Power (sp)`, `Strength (strg)`, `Clutch (clt)`

#### Glass Cannon 💣
This player's strategy is pure, unadulterated aggression. The goal is to hit a winner within the first few shots of every point, accepting a high number of unforced errors as the cost. It's a high-risk, high-reward style that aims to win matches quickly before stamina becomes a factor.
* **Primary:** `Serve Power (sp)`, `Strength (strg)`
* **Secondary:** `Groundstroke (gs)`, `Reflex (ref)`
* **Rubber Band:** `Serve Accuracy (sa)`, `Stamina (sta)`, `Clutch (clt)`

#### Iron Horse 🚂
An unusual but powerful combination. This player has the endurance of a baseline defender but uses that energy to fuel a massive serve deep into a grueling 5-set match. They aim to wear down opponents mentally by never showing fatigue on their most important shot.
* **Primary:** `Stamina (sta)`, `Serve Power (sp)`
* **Secondary:** `Serve Accuracy (sa)`, `Groundstroke (gs)`
* **Rubber Band:** `Reflex (ref)`, `Strength (strg)`, `Clutch (clt)`

#### The Specialist 🎯
This archetype is for the player who wants to build one, single, undeniable weapon at the expense of everything else. They might have a legendary forehand (`Strength`) but a mediocre backhand, or pinpoint serve accuracy (`Serve Accuracy`) with very little power. It's an unbalanced but potentially deadly build.
* **Primary:** `Strength (strg)`, `Serve Accuracy (sa)`
* **Secondary:** `Groundstroke (gs)`, `Clutch (clt)`
* **Rubber Band:** `Serve Power (sp)`, `Reflex (ref)`, `Stamina (sta)`

These archetypes create interesting strategic trade-offs. A "Glass Cannon" might dominate for two sets and then completely fall apart from fatigue, while an "Iron Horse" might be the opposite, starting slow but becoming unbeatable in the final set.
